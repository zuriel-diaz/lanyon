<p class="description">Hello my name is Zuriel Diaz (a.k.a. <a href="#">xthr3mx</a>), who I am? I am a warrior with a strong passion to solve problems through technology, highly curious. I have contributed as Software Engineer/Problem solver to many organizations through building web apps, APIs, and other crazy things that in this moment are helping more than 20M customers.</p>

<p class="description">I have a lot experiences, big failures, knowledge that are key on who I am right now. But...we have a lot of work to do, there are a lot of complex problems that we need to solve. I know the technology is not the response to all our problems, but is key in boost of our progress as society. This life gave us chance of break the reality, and build through our actions and solutions something better for our people. </p>

<p class="description">To be honest there are a lot of things that dislike me: talk with people with a closed mind, meet people that lives without passion...instead of this I prefer talk/discuss about problems, and ways to solve it. This is why the software development is one of my major passions, because has been a gift to help a lot of people.</p>
