Hello my name is Zuriel Diaz (a.k.a [xthr3mx](https://bitbucket.org/xthr3mx) or [ZurieLeader](https://twitter.com/@ZurieLeader) ). I am a gladiator, why? it is easy I use a quote all time on my mind and my heart: **NEVER GIVE UP!**. Thus I cannot give up on hard times, or in moments when a lot of people quit. This is key part on my life (in general, software development, sports,), my main skill is on problem solving, through this skill I help to a lot of enterprises, building web apps, APIs and other crazy things that helps to more than 20M customers to solve their problems.

I look through all this time in a retrospective…and has been a lot of good/bad experiences…from my first project building effects for christmas series on Microcontrollers, and moving to JAVA for standalone applications, school control apps, managing GNU/Linux systems ( Disclaimer: if you give me 5 minutes on a console, first you need go to the doctor and do a medical check). Some time ago I moved from my state to this amazing city, then I did contributions on TELECOM industry on transactional core, and web apps that are helping to customer on LATAM. Also I did contribute on startups: YoPropongo, later Open Intelligence, this was a great experience working with data, and sharing my experience with Agile frameworks like SCRUM. My passion and hard work has been key in all this process, also I worked at Compropago. Currently I am working on eCommerce industry and supporting at Cruz Roja as Technology consultant. One of my major passions is on Software architecture, Infrastructure, systems with high traffic, distributed systems, and AI.

In all this time I had bad experiences, big failures that are key on who I am right now. But work with humans is not easy, we need to improve on communication, negotiation. Sometimes technology is not answer to our problems, first we need to understand: what is the real problem. There are a lot of things that dislike me: talk with people with a closed mind, meet people that lives without a powerful passion, sit down and do not execute any actions to help to our people (we need to be honest with ourself, because we can help to our people to solve al least one real problem).
