<p class="description"><span class="highlight-text">Why I am doing this?</span> To be honest all knowledge that I have at this time has been a gift from a lot of people (scientist, developers, teachers, thinkers, ...), their work: books, papers, research, blogs, ideas are key on who I am, and now myself want contribute to our society through topics like web development, algorithms, databases, infrastructure.</p>

<p class="description"><span class="highlight-text">Why should you invest your time reading my posts or follow me?</span> My first steps were building technology to try understand life concepts, and solve problems. These skills led me as Problem solver/Software Engineer to help organizations. I think that all this experience and knowledge can be useful for you.</p>
